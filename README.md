## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

My thought process going in was to take inspiration and follow the trend of minamalistic design trends for websites that
were happening. While following that design principle I also used media queries to create a responsive design.

## Lessons Learned:

- Media Queries are an amazing tool that display the powerhouse that is CSS3.
- There's a reason why hamburger menus are so popular.
